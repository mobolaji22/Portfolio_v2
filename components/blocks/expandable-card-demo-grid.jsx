            Frontend development is constantly evolving, with numerous
            frameworks and libraries available to developers. Among the most
            popular are React and Vue.js, each offering unique features and
            advantages. In this article, we’ll compare React and Vue.js,
            exploring their differences, strengths, and what makes them suitable
            for different types of projects. We’ll also discuss what I expect to
            do in the HNG Internship and how I feel about using React.

            React: A Powerful and Flexible Library React, developed by Facebook,
            is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It has gained
            widespread popularity due to its component-based architecture,
            virtual DOM, and unidirectional data flow.

            Building a website today means ensuring it looks good and works well
            on any device, whether it&apos;s a large desktop screen or a small
            mobile phone. For a beginner, this can seem like a daunting task,
            but mastering HTML and CSS for responsive design is the foundation
            of front-end development. In this guide, I&apos;ll walk you through
            the essentials to help you create a website that adjusts beautifully
            to different screen sizes.
          </p>
          <h3>What is Responsive Design? </h3>
          <p>
            Responsive design is a web design approach where your web pages
            automatically adjust their layout based on the size and orientation
            of the user&apos;s screen. In other words, whether your visitor is
            using a smartphone, tablet, or desktop, the page should look good
            and be easy to use. Achieving this is primarily done through HTML
            for structure and CSS for styling, using techniques like flexible
            grids, media queries, and fluid images.
